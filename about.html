               Hi! I am Sasha Singh. I am currently a Computer Science major and an Entrepreneurship and Psychology minor at the University of Utah. 
               I spent the first 12 years of my life in New Delhi, India and the rest have been spent traveling to major cities all over the United States, which is one of the reasons I am extroverted and open to communicating with people from all walks of life and backgrounds.
               Currently I am located in Salt Lake City, the home of the greatest snow on earth, and I am lucky to call it home. I am also very lucky to be in the midst of Silicon Slopes, Startup culture, and the technology revolution as we see how the world around is changing. I come from a family of engineers, it was only fitting for me to fall in my parents footsteps and work as a Software Engineer on projects I find fascinating, whether that be in the Instagram division of Meta to analyze their explore pages, or at a FinTech that diversifies credit card reward programs based on consumer spending.
            </p>

            <p>
                What career would you like to use your degree for?
            </p>
            <p>
                I take a lot of pride in the work I did to hustle for an internship this past summer and found
                myself at Oracle, and will be returning there this summer! My dream job would be to work as a
                Software Engineer at a large tech firm that doesn’t just provide a way to grow my technical skill
                set but also my fascination with human interactive data. 
            </p>

            <p>Where do you see yourself in 10 years?

                I would like to be a Developer’s Advocate role acting as the liaison between a major technology
                company and its developer community. I am interested in people-facing roles and pursuing
                executive leadership roles. I would like to use the knowledge I gained with my certification from
                the Lassonde Entrepreneurial Institute and start my own company in the fitness or beauty
                industry, revolutionizing holistic healthy living and self-confidence.
            </p>

            <p>What do you like to do during your free time?

                While it is usually meant negatively, I really do think the best way to describe the things I like to
                I do in my free time “The Jack of all Trades, Master of None”!
                I have always loved to sing and dance, and I usually combine this with my obsession with
                fitness- and am currently looking to get Zumba certified! I wish to teach a class where I promote
                healthy habits, a mashup of my favorite pop and Indian music, and build a community of
                self-love.
                I also create beauty, skincare, and lifestyle content on Instagram where I speak up about my
                struggle with cystic acne and body image. I believe in providing organic, authentic content to my
                audience.
